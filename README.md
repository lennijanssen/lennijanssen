## Welcome, I am Lennart!

I am an aspiring Data Scientist, with a great passion for the mobility sector as well as everything that data can tell us.
Drawing from my experience in creating visions and project planning within the mobility sector, along with my education in data science & AI, I believe in the potential of cutting-edge technologies to profoundly impact how we, and goods, will move around in the future. I am open to collaborating with people that share this belief.
